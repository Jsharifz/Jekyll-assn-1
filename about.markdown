I am an aspiring Web Developer Student seeking new opportunities and challenges. My desire to learn new skills is what challenges me to further enhance my education and expertise for varying industries. Being part of the SAIT's Web Developer Fast-Track program helped me reinforce techniques and applications of languages such as Node.js/JavaScript, HTML, and CSS by taking on independent and collaborative assignments. To learn more about my previous experiences, you can view my profile on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javad-sharifzadeh-najafi-5b138558/).
