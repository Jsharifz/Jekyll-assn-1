# Lie Detector

A dad buys a lie detector robot that slaps you if you lie.

<br>

Dad: Son, where were you at school hours?

Son: At school. The robot slaps the son.

Son: Okay I was watching KungFu Panda! The robot slaps his son again.

Son: Okay I was watching violent movies!

Dad: What?! When I was your age I never watched those kinds of movies! The robot slaps the dad.

Mom: Haha, after all, he is your son. The robot slaps the mom...
