Bozo is a real special gem we have on our team. He brings joy and awe to all ages craving some slap-stick humor and theatrical art! He's been with us for over 15 years and that is why we trust him to orchestrate our events when we are overwhelmed by endless requests. When he's not wearing his makeup and silly hat of his, we call him George!
