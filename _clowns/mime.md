Mimic here is a fancy feisty fellow. We havn't given him an order in 2 and a half years, but he always knows where to go. We don't get to pick assignments for him, he choses them himself. Under the mask, Mimic is a gentle sigle widdower father of 2 named Garry. Before Mimic joined us, he strugled as an architect to find contracts to feed his 2 sons. Although he sometimes struggled to feed them some nights, he made sure they sleep with a smile on their head. When he was fed up with his career, he had the idea to one day come work for us; turns out those nights of entertaining his kids paid off quicker than his university degree.
